## Background

My passion is new technology: at work I'm the first to know about cutting edge ways we can make and deliver solutions, at play I am an archetypal early adopter. Throughout my 20 years’ experience in audio, broadcast operations, project management and software delivery I’ve gained extensive experience in the scoping, development and introduction of new and innovative technologies and partnerships. I have a broad range of technology industry contacts and have gained a strong reputation through my work on a number of mobile app, broadcast and audio/video IP delivery projects. These projects have helped enable central editorial and strategic policy, deliver new, more flexible ways of working, as well as help define the pace of change at both organisational and industry levels.  I take great pride in my work, and in particular my ability to lead on the development of new products and workflows encompassing bleeding edge, standards and commodity based technologies as well as mobile connectivity. In recognition of the need to continue to evolve and the pivot towards software defined and cloud based solutions it was a very easy decision for me to take the leap and acquire the additional software development skills necessary to continue to innovate. I'm very much looking forward to being able to build on my experience and put newly acquired skills to good use, helping deliver new partnerships and solutions within the technology sector.
